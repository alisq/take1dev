Introduction
In the month of April, just after the arrival of the pandemic, I was commissioned by Plug In ICA’s curator, Nasrin Himada, to edit the inaugural issue of Plug In ICA Editions Online. I decided to have a tête-à-tête four selected Winnipeg based emerging artists, as well as one artist from Montreal. In collaboration with the web-based artists, Ali Shamas Qadeer and Chris Lee, these discussions are going to be released online bi-weekly throughout the month of August and September.

Choosing the artists to include in the project was initially a challenge, but even in the most beautiful skies there are select stars that draw the eyes. I had the privilege of speaking with these five artists, all of whom I admire. The selected artists featured in this project hail from distinct artistic backgrounds, which consist of painters, photographers, performers, video artists, installation artists, printmakers textile art and beadwork. My keen interest in their art practices, and familiarity with the individual artists, prior to this project, were major reasons for my choice. Conversations with each artist took a life of its own, testing the waters of the unknown, the assumed, the most likely, and the profound.

It is my pleasure to introduce you to this auspicious quintet: Ekene Maduka, Annie Beach, Cassandra Cochrane, Iyunade Judah and Eve Tagny. Each of these artists are entitled to a solo in this one take jam.

The first artist that came to mind was Ekene Maduka. Ekene happened to be my studio partner for a number of years, while we sailed through art school. In my first year, Ekene was introduced to me as someone “who comes from a family of artists”, I later got the opportunity to meet her sisters Akum and Mercedes, both practicing artists. When I recall my nocturnal adventures with Ekene in our tidy white studio, I wish I could press the rewind button. Our relationship as fellow peers has always been heavily symbiotic; we have learnt a lot from each other, and supported one another generously. My favorite memories while sharing space with Ekene were the numerous musical performances we staged in front of our imaginary audience. We would sing songs by Nigerian musicians, like 2Face Idibia. Ekene sang tenor, while I ping ponged from alto to soprano, we thought we were great singers, and went on tour with the idea. My discussion with Ekene in this publication, is an extension of our jovial but thought-provoking studio chat, this time less colloquial.

Watching Annie Beach navigate the art scene, it becomes apparent that being an artist transcends mere talent or career success. Annie upholds morality and ethics in her practice and also in community involvements. Annie and I both work for the same institution as art teachers. I have had the opportunity to have multiple conversations and studio visits with Annie. Annie’s artistic engagement with the younger generation is a constant reminder for other artists—that we ought  to actively contribute to our immediate community and to society at large.

Have you ever seen an egg hatch before your eyes? I have seen Judah Iyunade undergo constant metamorphosis since I met him last summer. After a studio visit in my class at studio 393, we became research partners. One of Judah’s strengths is his humility, which has positively influenced his willingness to learn. I do hang out with Judah often, we discuss topics like the Oyo empire, Dahomey and other African civilizations. We share books, videos, and newly discovered artists with each other. When I first met Judah, he was an evergreen seedling, sprouting out of fertile earth, right now Judah has become the Iroko tree in the middle of the king’s compound, where the elders gather to drink Palm wine.

Cassandra Cochrane says it as it is without sugarcoating. I have come to appreciate her honesty and consistent humor. My respect for Cassandra grew tenfold, after watching her stand up for a Black student that was being harassed by a security personnel during her university days. Cassandra is well involved with community. She teaches beading to younger artists. Some of the teenagers and young adults who have attended her classes are now practicing artists in their own right. Cassandra’s practice occupies a unique space in the art scene, she stands at the intersection of installation and fashion design.

Knowing Eve Tagny personally has been a delight. Before my premier encounter with Eve, I had nothing but respect and admiration for her practice. I once said to a colleague, “Aren’t we fortunate to witness Eve Tagny happen?” Knowing how recycled the art scene can be, Eve’s work is definitely a breath of fresh air, her immersive practice sprints from being merely decorous to the creation of spaces for pause to process emotions, to grieve, and practice mindfulness. Eve brilliantly amalgamates video, photography, installation and performance, engaging human consciousness within those spaces.   

One constant factor that resonates among the practices of these artists is the autonomy from the parameters set by western academia. Although these artists are all well versed in knowledge born out of colonial drivel, they have all consciously taken a departure from the mothership of western jive to create their own spaces, with ideologies that are independent, but not in competition with whiteness.

Chukwudubem Ukaigwe is a Nigerian born song, dispersed by a transient Atlantic breeze, currently passing through Treaty 1 Territory, so called Canada. He consciously uses a variety of mediums to relay a plurality of ideas at any given time. He views his art as a conversation, or a portal into one, and in some instances, as an interpretation of this ongoing exchange. Chukwudubem weighs an occurrence, feeling, or idea on a scale and then creates a narrative in his own language. Chukwudubem operates as an interdisciplinary artist, curator, writer, and cultural worker. Chukwudubem Ukaigwe is the founder of Patterns Collective. His work could be found on Instagram @chukwudubemukaigwe.

INTRO
If white walls are to Art schools and Picasso to African motifs, I will liken Annie Beach’s career approach to that of Augusta Savage, because of her selfless contribution to community with her art practice. Annie Beach is a Canadian interdisciplinary artist, educator, curator and serial muralist. I have known Annie to be a bubble of joy and laughter, she is also a community leader and activist. My relationship with Annie as friends can be summarized in the following fact; we can have a full-blown conversation using only eye signals, especially in a colonial setting, haha.

INTERVIEW
CHUKWUDUBEM: Firstly, I would love to discuss your schedule, this is something I personally have been wanting to discuss with you for a while now. How do you keep sane? I have watched you play multiple roles in the Winnipeg art scene. I remember, for the most part of your undergraduate years, you were the president of the faculty’s student union, you were also a chairperson in multiple art groupings and organizations, sat on various boards. You founded and spearheaded a couple Bipoc collectives and collaborated with other collectives on a provincial and national scale, you were also able to facilitate and lead youth outreach programs and workshops, and still perform excellently in school. Now that you’re done with school, I would say, you have become a light to your peers and a beacon of hope to every youth growing up in the city, especially the bright indigenous youths of Winnipeg.

ANNIE: I ask myself that all the time, ha-ha! 

I've never really been a homebody; I've always been someone who would rather be out of the house and with other people in order to feel productive. Of course, with social distancing protocols in place, I've found myself having to adjust, but it's been positive, as I have been spending more time with myself and creating whatever I want, whenever I want. However, only a few short months ago, I was having regular 10-12 hour days, balancing being a full-time student, creating a body of work for the graduating, honours exhibition; doing part-time work teaching art for youth and children at multiple non-profits; co-leading the School of Fine Arts Student Association; and somehow managing to maintain a social and romantic life. 

This is not a schedule that just anybody could manage, but because I've been blessed to be doing what I love, and to have supportive family and friends, I am able to keep up with it all. And like you said, it feels all the more rewarding if the work I do can inspire another. I will admit that early, productive mornings really help me manage and accomplish more in a day, early bird gets the worm! 

And it took my first year of university to adjust to the change of pace and to get the swing of things, and that is when I became more involved in student politics. I made a connection on my first day with Kristin Flattery who appointed me as the person to replace her on the School of Fine Arts Student Association as Indigenous Student Representative, and maintained a connection with her. And from there, went on to be Co-President with Hanna Reimer, she's a superstar! And really held things afloat as I extended more of myself towards the University of Manitoba Indigenous Student Association, the Canadian Federation of Students, and even ran for University of Manitoba Student Union President with an all Black, Indigenous, People of Colour or BIPoC team, under the slate name Exist. We didn't “win,” but we did shake things up and inspired three candidates, all BIPOC women, to run for president this past election, which is amazing! All I hope is to inspire at least one person and I believe we truly did that.

And then on top of it all, teaching art workshops and instructing classes through an assortment of non-profits, community organizations, or schools. And juggling a part-time mural career in the midst of all that. But I do it all because I crave connecting with amazing Natives or BIPOC doing deadly things, in all sectors, and I love that I keep building networks in all areas; both fine art and public art, politics starting at university levels and up to national levels, and even activist spaces. 

CHUKWUDUBEM: Gone are the days when painters were painters and sculptors were sculptors. Nowadays, some artists do take a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary approach in executing their work. You have worked with painting, photography, animation, graphic design, ceramics, printmaking. You have taken a rather mathematical approach in creating; I mean the calculation, the intentionality that goes into your work, you don’t work in just in any medium, based on your ability to work in that medium. You do take into account, the subject being discussed before choosing a particular medium to work in, and also, how the conversation can be most accessible to your target audience. Is it right for me to say you have target audience?

ANNIE: As my body of work develops, I remind myself by asking the question, "who am I making my art for?" 

With direct-entry into the School of Art, I immediately was trained to create content that would be digestible towards white academics, steeped in unnecessary colonized theory and inaccessible language. I share this specifically because it wasn't until my fourth year of art school that I had been in a class taught by an Indigenous teacher, and the year that the School of Art had finally hired Indigenous Assistant Professors. Once I had the chance to work with Leah Fontaine, Lori Blondeau, and Katherine Boyer, that vastly changed my ideas of not only who I make my work for, but also who I want to help me develop my practice. I want mentors and teachers who understand Native code, cultural references, slang and jokes. Someone who can nourish my work, not just influence it. Having that help during the process helps me ensure that my audience stays focused on my community, my own friends and family, Natives across Turtle Island. If my own aunties or cousins can't understand or even enjoy my work, I'd be making work selfishly for myself and strangers, and then what's the point?

CHUKWUDUBEM: Satire is a big part of your practice. The rabbit with a gun, turning tables. You have mastered the colonial skill of painting, printmaking, etc. and have used it to spite colonial doctrines. The use of puns in your paintings is reminiscent of Kent Monkman and Chris Ofili, taking a profane approach in sending subtle stings to egos built on trampling on others.

ANNIE: Satire, puns, wordplay, these have such a huge role in my work. A lot of the time, I will start with a punny title or concept. I had the title "Bush Indian" in my head before I even knew I was going to make an eight-foot oil painting depicting a literal bush of hair!!! I enjoy the irony of taking English, a language myself and my direct relatives had no choice but to speak, and flipping it on its head. Or using it to invoke humor, especially when it's a language that has caused so much pain, the wordplay and ironic imagery, and the laughter that follows, is medicine.

CHUKWUDUBEM: I would say that memes are at the forefront of contemporary art. It is interesting how artists are able to offload a lot of heavy conversation, with the aid of a funny meme.

Your collage body of work ‘Lost and found’ does just that. At first glance at the work, you burst into laughter, then the seriousness of the work hits you, and you realize it is something you should digest and reflect upon. The humor serves the role of an accessible gateway to this historical critique that resides in these collages executed with brilliant principles of design.

ANNIE: I'm a little surprised these collages, which included what I would call "analog typography" read as memes. Don't get me wrong, I recognize and agree wholeheartedly the influence meme-culture has on the contemporary art scene, or memes being a form of art-making itself, and looking at them now I totally see the comparison to an image promoted caption, which is exactly the process of making these. I definitely referred to my own admiration of Ken Lum, his Portrait-Logo series, specifically the "Mounties and Indians" piece. The fun, flashy fonts and the sarcasm imbedded in the photographs. I found images that really resonated with me from some National Geographic magazines, imagined a context by finding accompanying text, and then experimented with the trimming and extending the text by hand to give equal impact to the messages. The hands-on process is what inspired the analog re-design of the text, which is even more interesting when compared to memes, made specifically to be consumed online.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Earlier, I spoke about taking colonial skills and using them as a form of resistance, but I also notice in your work, especially your performances, you reclaim certain words that were and are still demeaning to Indigenous peoples, you then explore the power dynamics these words possess. You play the alchemist, turning tears to chardonnay.

As I mentioned before, as much as inverting English, a foreign and colonial language, into humor, it can also be a tool for reclamation. One character I created, Wâpos Squaw, was influenced by Lori Blondeau and how she took the slur, "squaw" and examined its origins and history. I combined what is known as a derogatory term for woman, with "wâpos," Cree word for rabbit, an animal known for having a high sex-drive, and created "Bunny Woman." She was created to subvert the high-sexualized and harmful notions projected on Native women, specifically a troll on the internet that is referenced in my lightbox photo triptych piece, "fuxk you endlessly."

CHUKWUDUBEM: I really want to know more about the food in your large paintings, you have placed these food items that are stereotypical to Indigenous communities and reserves; like KLIK and SPAM. I also notice the generosity of fleshiness in the frames which these food items appear in. Is there a romantic correlation shared between these food items and the figures in the work?

ANNIE: Most definitely. This series which I finally titled, "One Devours, The Other Indulges and Feasts", specifically combines foods that have and continue to shape Indigenous identity today, foods and ingredients that are willingly celebrated today within our homes and our communities. These foods are also known historically as food rations, handed-out in government sanctioned reserves, influencing our diet and inflicting health problems today, and foods that include stereotypical imagery as a part of their packaging and marketing. I wanted to compare and contrast these realities.

The fleshiness is to make the bodies look delectable, raising the ultimate question, is food better than sex? As much as the depicted foods have hindered our traditional diets, our ceremonies have been taken through government-bans and our relationships with one another are near non-existent in popular media.  I wanted Native love and Native bodies, to be as desirable as food and sex, especially when, historically and today, we are so often desired, consumed, and discarded by violent, colonial rhetoric.

CHUKWUDUBEM: I have really been enjoying your oil painting series REDskin, the very large ones and the small ones too. These paintings do draw parallels to your photography series; BLOODLINE, where you have exaggerated the redness of the skin of the matriarchal lineage depicted in the photographs.

ANNIE: I had the idea of reclaiming the term "redskin" a few years ago. As a term that has held us back in a limiting sense, the colour red symbolizes so much; love, sex, passion, desire, lust, even anger, danger, strength. The colour is very powerful, and when used in the correct way, can be used in a positive way. In REDskin, I referenced photographs of parts of my own body, to invoke sensuality by taking fleshy, body shapes to create abstract, almost landscape imagery. This series was mainly used to experiment and learn more about oil painting and its materiality. However, in my Bloodline series, I digitally edited family members' skin in old photographs to be glowing red, to heighten this sense of otherness. When I shared the photos as part of my first solo exhibition, this past Winter, a show curated by a dear friend and collaborator, Brianna Wentz, I paired them with poinsettia flowers in my installation. I wanted to highlight how this flower, indigenous to this continent, is celebrated for its vivid red colour, but our skin was looked down upon for this reason.

CHUKWUDUBEM: The paintings in your REDskin series are frame specific depictions of suggestive body parts. You clearly debunk mainstream aesthetics of beauty, by exploring the validity and graciousness of non-idealized bodily features. These paintings remind me of the work of the Harlem born artist, Tschabalala Self, and also the Chicago based artist, Brittney Leeann Williams; I mean, the exploration of the topography and landscape of the female body is mind blowing and boundary stretching.

ANNIE: Looking back on this series, and comparing it to the work of Self or Williams, I see a lot of similarities in capturing the delicate beauty, the lumps and bumps of unconventional bodies that are nearly never celebrated for being their natural selves. I am unsure of the processes of these artists, but for my work, the photographs I referenced were selfie-images taken of my own body. This was the case for this series as well as the “Moon Cycle” piece. As someone who has struggled with body issues and self-esteem issues for as long as I remember, I was committed to showing great care and love for my own body, and through the nature of the selfie, the images always had an underlying sense of power to them, just naturally. Native women, unless depicted as hyper-sexualized women in headdresses, or as Disney Princesses, we are never celebrated for our natural bodies and the power of our physical forms. And if we don't fit this idealized image, instead we are targeted. The violence inflicted on our women and violence inflicted upon our land go hand-in-hand, they're one and the same. Both must be celebrated and protected.

CHUKWUDUBEM: I remember your work; Mooncycle was part of a group show I curated in 2019. Phenomenal work. A collection of small, circular paintings installed in a circular fashion, on the wall. The paintings were not just two dimensional, they also contained bear fur. You immediately recognize a tempo progression or regression, when cruising clockwise or anti-clockwise with your eyes. This Holy grail is loaded with information on menstrual cycle. Please do share with me, the scriptures attached to this work.

ANNIE: This is a very loaded piece, which I found all came together so naturally, which I always take as a good sign! I worked off of my Bush Indian piece, but Sharon Alward at the time said either I need to continue working BIG, or go small, and I had to make sure it wasn't art-school level of small, like Dollarama sized canvas, which in art school is a sin haha. I needed to go smaller than that, really heighten the intimacy and delicacy. I knew I wanted to continue the imagery of the crotch between legs and incorporating fur, and it wasn't until I found the wooden circles that it all clicked. Using 13 wooden circles, I would create 13 different images, to depict different stages of the moon, as it waxes and wanes. The moon is closely tied to women and femininity, specifically lining up with the same 28-day pattern the menstrual cycle. Our moon time is known as a time of cleansing, healing, a ceremony in itself. To capture the transformation of the moon, I equated the different phases to different types of panties; the g-string representing a crescent, high-waisted panties as a new moon, and no underwear as a literal full moon. The more scantily-clad, the more fur poked thru and out of the image. I arranged them in a circular formation to capture the movement of the moon around us, which tends to be my least favourite part of the work, although necessary, it takes forever to install haha. I enjoyed the installation aspect of this piece, something that I like to push more and more with my paintings as I go. 

CHUKWUDUBEM: You exhibited a performance piece in 2018 at the university of Manitoba quad, this performance really stuck with me because you referenced Rebecca Belmore while discussing the piece with your peers. Guess what? Rebecca Belmore’s solo show at the AGO was my initiation to the world of performance art.

I remember your performance to be very algebraic and calculative. Incredible detail was given to every inch of the work; the amount of stones, the source of the stones, your choice of people who worked on, and documented the piece. Kindly talk about the unfolding of that piece and the hilarious drama that followed.

ANNIE: I love this piece; it feels so special to look back on, and I think it was because it felt so ceremonial while doing so. You mention this piece being calculated, I would maybe say it was just done with good intentions and with care. The piece, ‘Reclaiming Our Land’ was for a third-year open-media class, I wanted to try something performance focused, and I don’t remember what sparked it, but I wanted it to be a critique of land acknowledgments on campus, and this idea of sticking to your word. If you truly recognize this as treaty land, belonging to these first nations, then don’t stand in our way if we try to reclaim that land. 

I had the idea to reference traditional medicine wheel petroforms found throughout our territories, these incredible feats of precision and intention. I told my teacher at the time, I won’t bother naming names, but when I said my next step was to reach out to an elder, he told me “don’t worry about it! You’re Indigenous, you can do whatever you want.” That didn’t sit well with me, obviously. I wanted to make sure it was done in a good way and for the right reasons. I knew with this piece being in public, it may be disrespected by a stranger. So, I made an appointment with Norman Meade on campus. He gave me his blessing and I went ahead with his advice. 

I shared an event link with Indigenous students and faculty on campus to share with each other, inviting whoever to join, and I hired two Indigenous students who do photography part-time. I wanted to include the campus community in the piece, and a few friends both Native and non-Native joined me throughout the day. I started by the Red River on campus, it was December so I dressed warm. I collected 100 rocks, smudged them one-by-one, and tied strips of coloured fabric, the colours of the medicine wheel, white, yellow, red, and black. I went to the quad and hung string around the trees to block off entrances to foot traffic, it was a real thin string though. If I could go back, I would find an alternative to that part because people were accidentally clotheslining themselves if they weren’t paying attention to where they were walking, haha, I felt so bad.

I carried the rocks from the river to the quad, with help of some friends who joined me, and arranged them in the cardinal directions, expanding across this large field of public space on campus. I was so nervous someone would tell me to stop, I never asked for permission to use the space or enact the performance, which was risky, but I felt that if anyone were to try to stop it, I would throw the land acknowledgement in their face, repeat it until they got the message. It fortunately never came to that. 

My favorite moment however, was once we finished, I saw this young man running, just booking it from University Center towards the bus stop, and he was about to cut through the quad but abruptly stopped and looked around at what was before him, this medicine wheel, and after a moment, he continued to run but instead, ran around the quad space. That meant a success to me, if at least one person could understand the message, to take a moment to stop, reflect and adjust, that’s what I was aiming to seek from the public.

I actually never know what happened to that work, I intended to return everything back to the river like how it was installed, but it was cleared and made way for an ice rink I believe, which was too bad that I couldn’t address and return things to its place, but I know I did what I could to thank Creator for the use of its gifts for the work.

CHUKWUDUBEM: I noticed a cyclic attribute in that performance, I mean your reference to the medicine wheel. This characteristic also appears strongly in your installation, Moon cycle. Is a cultural importance attached to circles?

ANNIE: Circles are everywhere! It's the core to nearly all our teachings, the medicine wheel, the sacred hoop, cycles of the sun, the moon, day and night, the seasons, the cycle of our lifespan until death, and how we return back to the Earth, everything is connected. When I was 18 years old, I attended free Hoop Dance classes with Shanley Spence and learned lots about these teachings then. And more and more, I try to include the circle or cycles in my work, to enforce these teachings, and make it recognizable stories or imagery to Native audiences. For my Honours work, which unfortunately never took final form due to cancellation over COVID-19, I wanted to explore this idea with the installation of my work. I wanted to replicate the circular nature of ceremonial spaces; tipis, sweatlodges; to heighten this idea, with the help of the painting content, of equating sex with ceremony, the expressing of love being a ceremonial act. I hope that eventually I can exhibit this series in a space that could accommodate this. 

CHUKWUDUBEM: You curated a group show; Wâhkôhtowin, early this year. The show featured exclusively female, indigenous artists. The opening reception was spectacular; ceremonial drums, homemade food, loving people. It was clearly more than an art show, it was a communal bonding experience. One thing that stuck out for me, was how you made the diverse works in the show to seem cohesive, by painting golden rectangular frames around the work.

ANNIE: Yes, the initial idea for the show was one piece that was included in the show by Mackenzie Anderson, ‘Nikicikisin sahkiwein (I remember love)’ this phenomenal and delicate collage piece of family photographs arranged and sewn together. When I continued to build together artists and works for the show, keeping the photograph in mind, I thought of the event having a guest book, this old photo album with an Indian in a headdress on the front cover, which has sat in our storage forever from the endless items my late Papa had thrifted in his years. I thought of traditional photo albums with these thin, golden borders that some have. I wanted to tie in my skills as a muralist and large-scale painting skills to unify all the works with a golden border. The Taché Gallery is a large space, and although it was a group show, there was a lot of space, and in order to give each piece breathing room, but also power, these golden borders gave them all a strong presence on their own, while joining them together visually.

CHUKWUDUBEM: I remember assisting last you in painting a mural last year, commissioned by synonym art consultation, in collaboration with graffiti programming. I know you have painted a ton of murals, and most interestingly, you often collaborate with school and community kids to execute some. Which mural of yours would you say is your favorite?

ANNIE: Definitely the piece that you had a hand in helping me with, created this past fall, September 2019 with Synonym Art Consultation and their Wall-to-Wall Mural and Cultural Festival. I loved this piece because it was created through their Mentorship Program that is with Graffiti Art Programming Inc. and included workshops at their satellite and community sites, Studio 393 and Turtle Island Neighbourhood Centre. Youth participants had a chance to participate in workshops that I lead to prompt inspiration for the mural. I decided on a design that reference Moccasin Slipper flowers, and Dakota Skipper butterflies, both native to this area. The Moccasin Slipper or Lady Slipper flower has a beautiful origin story of a young girl’s community becoming sick. She ventures to the neighbouring community for medicine in winter. She finds the medicine, and instead of waiting until morning, she treks home at night. Her feet lose their moccasins in the snow, but she continues. She makes it home and heals her community. The next Spring, these flowers bloomed where her feet stepped. Better yet, while painting the mural, a passerby recognized the flower and told me about its medicinal properties and that yellow ones are found abundantly by Brokenhead First Nation where I have some family ties, which meant a lot. Always feels good when these connections are made, like everything falls into place so naturally sometimes. Community members hanging out by Thunderbird House next door enjoyed the work. It also feels good to have created a work that’s my own design, as most previous murals involved collaborating with another artist or directly with students and youth participants. I had more of a hand in the decisions of what was in this piece and had creative control, which feels rare at times in public art. And I love this piece because PINK!!!! So much pink!!!!!!!!! 

Another favourite mural piece I did, I have to mention because it was really unique. I worked with the grade six students of my own, former, middle school, John Henderson Junior High. I worked with a select dozen or so students to collaborate on a design and the entire grade six class to paint it. This mural, however, was on the outdoor basketball court on the pavement in the back parking lot. It incorporated the seven sacred teachings with graphic shapes and bright colours, with maintaining a playable court for the students to enjoy. I loved with one because I got to hire my buddy, Skye Spence, to help take some drone footage for documentation! Which was nice because before that, I hadn't really seen the finished and final product, haha!

Ekene Emeka-Maduka2020-09-12Quantum Superposition
INTERVIEW
“Please, can I have a grandé English breakfast and two cheese croissants.” This is a combination of words I have become familiar with after a few years, it is what Ekene Maduka orders during short breaks in between long morning classes. I am glad to have known Ekene for a while now. We both enrolled in a couple of the same classes during her years of art school. We sat alongside each other as we listened to one more fun fact about Jeff Koons and Larry Poons. Ekene gained the respect of her peers, thanks to her relentless hard work, layered ways of seeing, and dynamic thought processes.

CHUKWUDUBEM: I see paintings as a ritual. The art of painting also happens to be the art of kneeling, back bending, eye squinting, solvent inhaling, canvas worshipping. Take me through your process, what sets the stage for a perfect brush to canvas romance?

EKENE: Painting is definitely a ritual and as a painter yourself it’s no surprise you describe it as such. A lot of things happen in the process of setting up–I always feel excited about seeing my ideas develop into something tangible. I do feel anxious sometimes–it’s a weird trill and it happens often before new paintings. Typically, I clean brushes and pick out different paints to lay on the palette. I always have turpentine in a jar to clean brushes in between. I also always pick things to listen to, based on how I'm feeling. Selection is mostly one of the following: Jazz, ambient sounds, Afrobeat, RnB, Korean music (genre still RnB) or a podcast. For Podcasts my go to is The New Yorker Fiction or The Great Women Artists with Katy Hessle.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Apart from the sumptuous view your paintings exude, your work is full of life. You seem to have successfully mastered the metaphoric art of dramatism (from costume to facial gestures, to your use of space, to positioning, to hand gestures, posture, etc.). You cannot walk past a painting by Ekene without taking a lengthy pause. I find myself cruising through the variables of precedence and outcomes: what happened just before and what’s going to happen just after this frame. Is this complex theatre a theme you always consider while narrating your simple but layered stories?

EKENE: Yes, definitely. I'm glad you feel those things staring at my work. That is something I want the paintings to feel like, climax of a movie or the middle of a book. I believe that comes from the kinds of storytelling predominate in my childhood.  Growing up in Nigeria, I was surrounded with books like Lantern, Pepeye and Dandiaja or Eze goes to school so that has been a big influence. If not those aforementioned, some sort of dramatic folklore surely replaced that. When I make paintings, I want people to spend time thinking about the subject like a cliff-hanger.  I said a lot already, but I'd just like to add that ideally, I'd like for people to get a sense of–not necessarily being overwhelmed but taking in the multiple layers of a single moment.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Your work seems to be centred on critiquing the Nigerian reality. I grew up in Lagos (southwestern Nigeria), you grew up in Kano and Abuja, different parts of Northern Nigeria. One of the many discussions we had during our time as studio partners in art school, was drawing parallels between our Nigerian experiences. It's safe to say our experiences and perceptions of Nigeria are very similar and yet totally different, and it manifests in your work in an uncanny fashion, at least for me.

EKENE: In as much as I talk about things potentially applicable to a generic and general idea of being Nigerian or experiencing Nigeria, my work is highly subjective. I want that push and pull to be present because in reality, people from the same nation have different experiences based on who they are and what they are exposed to. We are limited to what we know, and our experiences inform our knowledge of things. I largely focus on doing that with my work which is why I am the subject of the work. My goal is to tell stories based on my knowledge and experiences. I'm very curious to know what instances the work feels unfamiliar to your own experience.

CHUKWUDUBEM: If I am truthful, the opinions and perception of life in the ‘Nigerian experiment’ drastically varies based on gender, religion, location, class, sexual preference, age etc. Therefore, there might be no such thing as a microcosm of Nigerian ideas, values or perception. How do you confront this in your work? Especially because you’re now based in Canada. You seem to be that artist that takes a few steps away from the canvas to see the whole picture. Do you feel like you are looking at Nigeria from the outside, like one would look into an orbuculum?

EKENE: In some ways I get that feeling but also not really. Moving to Canada almost five years ago today made me re-evaluate myself and made me more inquisitive about the life I lived while in Nigeria. Canada isn't completely home yet it’s just where I am based. The most fundamental parts of my life, over fifteen years, happened while I lived in my home country, so all I know has been heavily informed by that time. I'm also still strongly connected to home since my parents, friends and extended family members live there. I also try to keep up with the news as much as possible. I'd say it’s more or less a case of the best of both worlds so to speak.

CHUKWUDUBEM: You predominantly paint images of yourself, and that gives your work an interesting duplicative quality. In your Family Portrait series, you painted singular portraits of yourself as your parents and siblings, while other paintings like After hours contain multiple figures. One thing remains constant in your paintings, which is the never-ending ‘drama’.

EKENE: Definitely. It's gotten to the point where I almost don't think of my image as something deeper than just contours of different shades of brown–light and shadow making up a subject. The Family Portrait series was a little different and I looked at myself a little differently. In that work I was playing with the idea of living so closely to my nuclear family but having later realizations that there is so much to them as subjective individuals outside of the role they play in the family unit. I was triggered to make this partly based on observation that a lot of Nigerian kids around me growing up had experienced something similar. They didn't know too much about who their parents were outside of being caregivers. I wanted to highlight that each member of the nuclear family is a complex individual with a subjective role that takes up totally different forms outside the family unit. The work was a portrayal of that complex reality that exists in the family. It touches on the idea of being so close but yet so far away. To know and not to know as much despite numerous years of familiarity. My goal was to paint images of impulsive impressions I have of each member of my family reducing these individually complex beings to one generic idea that exists of them: Mom, dad and my two sisters.

CHUKWUDUBEM: In some of your paintings, like Morning assembly, the figures are almost herd-like. In this particular painting, the figures seem cloned, like they are a product of a series of biological fissions from a mother cell. You nicely grouped these figures with similar hairstyles and dressing, I suppose they are Nigerian students standing during one of those long and repetitive morning assemblies. In this case they look like chemical isotopes of the same element, but in other paintings like Last Supper, the figures imitate chemical elements with totally different properties. I mean, you play the role of various people of different class structures, age, gender, agendas, and sector of the economy. Your painting Last supper summarizes the neocolonial orgy that is ever present in the Nigerian reality.

EKENE: Yes, and all intentionally. You have a pretty good grip of what I am hopefully trying to do, and I like your way of using chemistry as a metaphor–that's new to me. In Morning Assembly, the images of myself are replicated and repetitive. Looking closely, each version of myself in the assembly line has a unique personality–it's slight but present. In the Last Supper however, I wanted to embody each of those characters. Funny background story: I was making that painting while renewing my study permit and some people close to me were doing other immigration related things. It was interesting that in reality I was playing the role of the Nigerian immigrant while in a painting embodying an immigration officer who makes crucial decisions that have the ability to hinder or allow for progression in my current status. If you're familiar with the immigration process you can attest that it's a little nerve-racking and also not a very pleasant experience.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Authors like Chinua Achebe and Akwaeke Emezi have discussed reincarnation or the Igbo traditional phenomenon of Ogbanje in their work. Is this something you ever think about, especially, because you do play with the idea of the recurring?

EKENE: I certainly explore recurrence in my work. I do that by appearing multiple times in an image or thinking of inventive ways I can discuss things that have already been discussed in human history for decades. Nothing is new. I don't explore it in the way that Achebe or Emezi have in their works, but I admire the way they do. I like how Emezi has done something inventive in depicting the concept of Ogbanje. When I read her book Freshwater, I felt like she took subject matter that has commonplace in Nigerian society and re-explained it in a context I personally haven't come across. It also related to contemporary times as well–that was refreshing.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Do you ever make abstract relationships between your paintings? What are the possibilities that one of the girls in Morning Assembly is a cousin to the girl in Across the Table, who is a daughter of the sleeping Buhari in Last supper, who is the...[starts laughing].

EKENE: That's interesting, I haven't done that per se. I've only ever sort of done that when talking about code-switching in After Hours. In that instance, I was thinking of it more as the multiple parts of a person that exist and what parts we choose to exhibit based on where we find ourselves or who we are around. In the two selves, I was thinking of them as sisters though.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Bruce Onobrakpeya, the great Nigerian contemporary artist, spoke about ‘The Zaria art society’ which later became ‘The Zaria Rebels,’ spearheaded by Uche Okeke in its inception. This group sprung up in the late 50s during Bruce’s formative years at the Nigerian College of Technology, now known as the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. Onabrakpeya states: this group’s primary aim was to decolonize the visual arts as taught by European expatriates. They went to classes almost only to acquire technical skills and turned down the volume of their ears to other aspects. This discussion group ganged up after classes for research and discussions around creating expressions that were reflective of their African heritage, and that is what shaped him as an artist.

The same applies to us I suppose, even if we haven’t given our research groups a name, a few of us have actively tuned into multiple channels outside the walls of Koons and Poons or Monet and Manet. Would you say, having this complex dictionary of Nigerian art history, Pan-African art history, history on Native American and Asian art, in conjunction with the pale skinned history we are being fed in school, has given you an edge over your peers? If such a thing as “an edge over your peers” even exists.

EKENE: I love this question because it's real and it seems to be the reality of many students of colour studying art in the west. Definitely feel free to quote me on this–a lot of western art school curriculum lacks diversity. Now the problem with that is it isn't very realistic and doesn't reflect the current world we live in. It's dated. We need to be fed with a long list of artists from various parts of the globe as students to build a rich vocabulary of source material and references. In reality, you don't walk into a major museum or gallery these days and see just Van Gogh's and the like. What you'd likely see is a Van Gogh right next to, or in the same room with a work by Chris Ofili or even beside a work by an emerging artist making work linking to similar subject matter. The current curriculum should reflect that reality and diversity. 

CHUKWUDUBEM: If we were to call a kola nut a kola nut; until the end of the 90s and the wake of the 2000s, not many Nigerian women were taken seriously as artists on a global scale. I mean we have, Ladi Kwali Mary Evans, Ndidi Dike, Nike Okundaye, and none of these women are even painters. It’s not like there were no female artists in Nigeria at the time, but most of their work was often reduced to craft by society. This still poses to be a problem, especially when looking for role models from a particular era or movement. I have had to turn to African-American art and the Harlem Renaissance for research on art made by Black women from the 30s to the birth of the 80s, apart from Ladi Kwali. With the advent of a rising number of African female artists, do you think this wall has finally been broken? Because I think it’s still a work in progress.

EKENE: Undoubtedly a work in progress but not to say no progress has been made. Ideally, I wish I was able to reference female artists from the past and I wish they were recognized and given the same opportunity to be recorded in the trajectory of art history. As this sadly is not the case, I do not completely disregard works by male artists who made work in that timeline. What I do is look them up and see what they were doing. When I do this, I think of what I can take, change or add to what they've done as a female artist.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Your career has been undergoing a rapid acceleration recently, and a lot of exciting things have happened to you in the past year. If you were to pick an event that was the most exciting, what would that be?

EKENE: Haha, thanks for saying that. A lot of things I'm grateful for have happened. I've sold a lot of work recently but if I had to pick one thing that was shocking, I'd say the Dean Collection Grant I received. Not to say I wasn't deserving of that opportunity, but I always approach applications keeping in mind that I might not be successful and that It's okay if I'm not.

CHUKWUDUBEM: Thank you.
